# Basic-Windows-Driver

Basic Driver for Windows used for me to debug and test some programs I'm currently working on. 

At the moment...

* Driver will print out a sample message upon load.
* Driver will need to be unloaded manually (most likely through a PC reset for now...)


# Basic-Windows-Driver

Tested on Windows 10 (Build 19045) [Driver Signature Enforcement Disabled]
